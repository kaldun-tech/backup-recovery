# Simple External Drive Backup Configuration Template
# ============================================================================
#
# This is a template for backing up your Documents and Pictures folders
# to an external hard drive. It's designed to be simple and straightforward
# for users getting started with the backup-recovery tool.
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Replace "$HOME" with your actual home directory path if needed
#    - On Linux/Mac: Typically /home/username or /Users/username
#    - On WSL: /mnt/c/Users/username (for Windows user directories)
#    - Or keep $HOME and let the system expand it automatically
#
# 2. Update backup_directory to point to your external drive:
#    - Linux: /mnt/external or /media/username/drive_name
#    - Mac: /Volumes/drive_name
#    - WSL: /mnt/d or /mnt/e (for Windows D: or E: drives)
#
# 3. Save this file with a meaningful name (e.g., my-backup-config.yaml)
#    and run: backup-recovery --config my-backup-config.yaml
#
# ============================================================================

# Profile: A named backup configuration you can run
profiles:
  simple:
    # Human-readable name for this backup profile
    name: "Documents and Pictures Backup"

    # Paths to backup
    paths:
      # First backup target: Documents folder
      - path: "$HOME/Documents"
        # include: Specify file patterns to backup (glob patterns)
        #   "**/*" means all files and subdirectories
        include:
          - "**/*"

        # exclude: Specify patterns to skip (takes precedence over include)
        exclude:
          - "**/.*"           # Hidden files (dot files like .config)
          - "**/tmp/**"       # Temporary directories
          - "**/.Trash/**"    # Trash/Recycle bin
          - "**/node_modules/**"  # Dependencies (can be reinstalled)

      # Second backup target: Pictures folder
      - path: "$HOME/Pictures"
        include:
          - "**/*"
        exclude:
          - "**/.*"           # Hidden files
          - "**/cache/**"     # Cached thumbnails and previews
          - "**/.Trash/**"    # Trash/Recycle bin

      # ADDITIONAL PATHS (uncomment to enable):
      # - path: "$HOME/Desktop"
      #   include:
      #     - "**/*"
      #   exclude:
      #     - "**/.*"
      # - path: "$HOME/Downloads"
      #   include:
      #     - "**/*"
      #   exclude:
      #     - "**/.*"
      #     - "**/incomplete/**"  # Skip unfinished downloads

# ============================================================================
# STORAGE BACKENDS
# ============================================================================
# Choose where to store your backups. Only enable ONE backend at a time.

# AWS S3 Configuration
# Requires AWS credentials configured in ~/.aws/credentials or environment
aws:
  enabled: false
  # Optional configuration:
  # bucket: "my-backups"
  # region: "us-east-1"
  # encryption: true  # Use server-side encryption

# Proton Drive Configuration
# Requires Proton credentials configured
proton:
  enabled: false
  # Optional configuration:
  # encryption: true

# Local External Drive Backup
# Point this to an external hard drive or NAS mount
local:
  enabled: true
  # IMPORTANT: Update this path to your external drive!
  # Linux examples:
  #   /mnt/external
  #   /media/username/MyDrive
  #   /mnt/backup
  # Mac examples:
  #   /Volumes/MyDrive
  # WSL examples:
  #   /mnt/d (Windows D: drive)
  #   /mnt/e (Windows E: drive)
  backup_directory: "/mnt/backup"

  # compression: Reduce backup size (slower, but saves space)
  compression: true

  # encryption: Encrypt backups locally before storing
  # RECOMMENDED for sensitive data
  encryption: false

# ============================================================================
# FILE CLASSIFICATION (Required for multi-tier backups)
# ============================================================================
# Automatically categorize files for appropriate storage tiers:
# - sensitive: Files that go to encrypted Proton Drive
# - critical: Files that go to both AWS and local storage (air-gapped backup)
#
# Note: If you only use local backup, define 'critical' patterns to specify
#       which files should be backed up locally. Files not matching any
#       pattern will only go to AWS (if enabled).
classification:
  # Sensitive files - stored in encrypted Proton Drive
  sensitive:
    keywords: ["password", "financial", "tax", "medical", "private"]
    file_extensions: [".key", ".pem", ".p12"]

  # Critical files - stored locally for air-gapped offline protection
  # Uncomment and customize these patterns for your needs
  critical:
    patterns:
      - "**/Documents/**"     # All documents
      # - "**/Pictures/**"    # All pictures
      # - "**/Important/**"   # Specific important folders
      # - "**/*.pdf"          # All PDF files
